Projects:
  - Name: MVOS
    Place: MediaVue Systems
    Description:
      - Designed, maintained and improved Embedded OS for SureVue Digital Signage products. "MVOS" is based on
      - Ubuntu Linux, engineered for autonomous 24/7 operation, post-deployment. Base OS is configured in a typical
      - manner for a headless server or IOT device. Remote configuration and control is provided by proprietary client
      - software, which connects each SureVue to MediaVue's "ANM" cloud service. Failover provided by redundant "call-home"
      - service. I leveraged Systemd extensively for service orchestration and dependency management to provide reliable,
      - predictable startup and shutdown. User Session and Signage software orchestration was implement via a Systemd Unit
      - and a combination of Shell scripting and user "services".
    Highlight:
      - My proudest achievement WRT MVOS is the work I put in to implement an in-field LTS upgrade mechanism. This allows
      - even legacy systems to upgrade from an older LTS base to a current LTS, skipping interim releases. This "leapfrog"
      - feature requires careful assessment of the system state pre-upgrade, utilized a package manifest method, and ensures
      - a predictable, stable system state and guaranteed upgrade result. The officially supported upgrade path for Ubuntu
      - requires a system be fully upgraded to each interim LTS version - I engineered a way to upgrade from Ubuntu 16.04
      - directly to 20.04, skipping the 18.04 release entirely. It was a challenging task, and required years of work to
      - achieve this success.
